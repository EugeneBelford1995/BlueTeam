This essentially accepts a whitelist of who should have been delegated rights on a given OU via a CSV (example CSV is included). It then checks the provided OUs against the whitelist and 'pops hot' on violations, outputs to the terminal & a text file named by OU, and resolves GUIDs in the text file.
